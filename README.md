**Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mark Lotspaih, a continuously learning IT generalist and project manager.**

- :hammer: I'm currently working to prepare in-district and distance learning technology for staff and students returning to school or learning from home
- :books: Iâ€™m learning more about automating :robot: with [Powershell](https://nostarch.com/powershellsysadmins) and making interactive websites with [Javascript](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/javascript-the-definitive/9781491952016/)
- :thought_balloon: I'd like to learn more about NoSQL databases (*e.g. [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo)*), responsive web design, and UI/UX
